# Variables
The var statement declares a list of variables; as in function argument lists, the type is last.

A var statement can be at package or function level. You can see in the example.

Note: The example shows how to create the equivalent of an Enum class by using the const statement. Within a constant declaration, the predeclared identifier iota represents successive untyped integer constants. It is reset to 0 whenever the reserved word const appears in the source and increments after each ConstSpec. It can be used to construct a set of related constants. It also implements the Switch statement and other methods as a practice.
